Thanks for getting this package!  We’re trying to build huge library of complimentary assets for you to use, and every bit of support helps tremendously.

Here’s some important things:

1)  Please RATE & REVIEW this package.  You can do so from the Asset Store window.  Your rating is great, but an honest review is even better.  If you are having a bad experience, however, please contact us via email or the forums instead, so we can fix address any issues right away.

2)  There is a simple demo showcasing animations.  There's more you can do if you choose to use layers in your Animator Controller, and there's a very simple implementation of that in the demo.  But!  We provide lots of video tutorials on YouTube.  So….

3)  Please visit http://www.InfintyPBR.com and click on the page for the package you just bought.  There will be YouTube videos for you to check out.  Each should be in depth and the descriptions will tell you what exactly the video shows.

4)  Please check out the .pdf file included in the package.  There’s lots of helpful tips as well as some important coding information.  It’s not a huge document, and should be pretty straight forward.

Thanks again!

PS:  The Dragon really is a bit more complicated than our other packages.  We have a few scripts to make things a bit easier, so please please please do check out the Youtube videos and, when you're making your textures for export, please use the "Dragon DEMO" prefab, as that has the helper scripts already attached.



DRAGON RIDER
The "Dragon Rider" model & prefab is intended to be used with our "Human Base + Barbarian" package.  The Human package is required, as the rigging is specific to the characters, and all the parts (hair/clothing) are animated.  There is a separate PDF file for Dragon Rider.

You can download a Dragon Rider demo scene from http://www.InfinityPBR.com -- both the Dragon Package & the Human Base + Barbarian Package should be in your project before you install the demo package.

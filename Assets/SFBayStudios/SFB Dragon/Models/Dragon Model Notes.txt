NOTES ON DRAGON MODELS

October 9th, 2016

The latest version of the animations are on the Dragon Rider v2 model.  The animations will work on the Dragon Master model, but ultimately theyâ€™re the same model.  The Dragon Rider only has a placeholder for the human bodies, and bones to work with those.
